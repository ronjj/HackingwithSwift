what I learned from this tutorial

// Navigation Link for going to new pages. This is very important and a fundamental part of iOS

// Geoframer. Good way of resizing images based on devices size

// Scrollingview. Another key component of iOS

//Using codeable and JSONDecoder to use that information

//Formatting dates in a more readable way
